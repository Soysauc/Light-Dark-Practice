# This is a practice session for a Common Light v Dark theme

I noticed my Githib was looking a bit on the empty side. This is mostly because for work I use their private github to make updates and not my personal github. But for the sake of keeping my commits up, I will be performing daily projects, whether larger or smaller so that I may also be building projects away from the day to day labor of a full time job.
